Each year in the United States, more than
100,000 people are diagnosed with kidney
failure, a serious condition in which the
kidneys fail to rid the body of wastes.1
Kidney failure is the final stage of chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
Diabetes is the most common cause of
kidney failure, accounting for nearly
44 percent of new cases.1 Even when
diabetes is controlled, the disease can lead
to CKD and kidney failure. Most people
with diabetes do not develop CKD that is
severe enough to progress to kidney failure.
Nearly 24 million people in the United
States have diabetes,2
 and nearly 180,000
people are living with kidney failure as a
result of diabetes.
