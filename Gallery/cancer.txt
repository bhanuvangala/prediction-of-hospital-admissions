ASCO developed two types of forms to help people diagnosed with cancer keep track of the treatment they received and medical care they may need in the future: a Cancer Treatment Plan and a Survivorship Care Plan. A Cancer Treatment Plan is a form that provides a convenient way to store information about your cancer, cancer treatment, and follow-up care. It is meant to give basic information about your medical history to any doctors who will care for you during your lifetime. A Survivorship Care Plan is a form that contains important information about the given treatment, the need for future check-ups and cancer tests, the potential long-term late effects of the treatment you received, and ideas for improving your health.
